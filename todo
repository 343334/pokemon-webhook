create a readme for configuration and setup / running


specific configuration  google api and cloud token in lib/encounters.rb
twitter/groupme/slack tokens in config/environment
look into fences as duplicates in fences1.json and config.json.example - is fences dir necesary? as geofence.rb seems like it will cause an error if it doesnt load from that path and not just the config file?
move global config variables to config ie google api key, cloud token, garbage pokemon variable, twitter time limit/queue amount - make global for all services
include gym/raid notifications
create variables for useGroupMe useTwitter useSlack and dont halt if those specific vars ie twitter secret key are not set
